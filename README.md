Some Java Projects using Docker

## Timetable

* Each day is split in 4  Sessions, 90' each. Approx. 45' teaching/presentation followed by 30' training labs and 15' discussion/chat
* Training should start at 9:00 local time (8:00 in Germany) and will end approx. 16:15. So we have two 15' coffee breaks and lunch 45' 
* Trainer will prepare a public repository on GitHub to provide you asap with his samples/whiteboard script. Additionally you will receive credentials so every participant may push his/her sources to separated branches. So it is easy to discuss your approaches/solutions/problems online.
